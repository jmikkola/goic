# goic

The name comes from merging "Go" and "c" (plus another letter to make it sound better).
The idea is to build a small c-like language with more go-like syntax.

Current status: There's a parser, a typechecker, and I'm just starting on the compiler.

The eventual goal is to try to learn x86_64 assembly.
